# Codex App secondary mirror sync

Cloudflare Worker + Workflow that copies the current R2 mirror into the
secondary S3-compatible mirror from Cloudflare's network instead of a GitHub
hosted runner.

## Flow

1. GitHub publishes the Release and finishes the R2 `latest/*` sync.
2. GitHub calls `POST /sync/start` with the release tag.
3. The Workflow removes abandoned staging objects and multipart uploads older
   than `SECONDARY_SYNC_STAGE_GRACE_HOURS`, then reads R2 in ranges and uploads
   objects to an IHEP staging prefix.
4. It copies staging objects to `latest/*` on IHEP, committing `latest/manifest`
   after installers, Sparkle archives, checksums, and appcasts.
5. It removes stale latest aliases that are absent from the current manifest,
   prunes stale `latest/mac/*` Sparkle archives outside the grace window, and
   removes staging objects. If upload or commit fails, it also attempts to
   remove the current instance's staging objects before preserving the original
   Workflow error.

The default staging grace window is two hours. It protects recent concurrent
instances while bounding storage leaked by interrupted or terminated Workflows.

## Required secrets

Set these with `wrangler secret put`:

- `SYNC_AUTH_TOKEN`
- `SECONDARY_S3_ENDPOINT`
- `SECONDARY_S3_BUCKET`
- `SECONDARY_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `SECONDARY_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

GitHub Actions should store the public Worker endpoint in
`CF_SECONDARY_SYNC_URL` and the same bearer token in `CF_SECONDARY_SYNC_TOKEN`.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run check
npm run deploy
```

Start a sync:

```bash
curl -fsS "$CF_SECONDARY_SYNC_URL/sync/start" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CF_SECONDARY_SYNC_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"releaseTag":"codex-app-26.623.41415","force":false}'
```

Check status:

```bash
curl -fsS "$CF_SECONDARY_SYNC_URL/sync/status?id=<workflow-instance-id>" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CF_SECONDARY_SYNC_TOKEN"
```
